# todotask

Hello

I'm Ahmad awad.

I'm happy to tell you about the successfully task.

I managed your time effectively to ensure that you meet deadlines without compromising quality. I
avoided
procrastination and allocate sufficient time for each stage of the task.

My task was Todo application using ( Bloc stateManagement and NoSql LocalStorage ).

I made the todo contain three fields(id,title,description and stateOfTask(complete or pending))ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
I could add other fields such as (Date of todo), but i thought this enoughðŸ˜Š
If you want to add some thing please send me , my contact information is the end of the file ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡

Where user can add,update and delete todo && can make the todo complete and pending
But(When user click on todo => I sent the date about constructor (Mean i didn't use the method for
get specific todo , because i want do new something in task but if you want to get one todo i am
ready please send me ) )

When user update or pending the todo => i want to click on button for (pending or complete in
AddUpdatePage).Mean if user want to make the todo complete , you have to click on button the
complete in AddUpdate page , also the same on pending task

Also i made update and add todo in one page (i sent parameter in constructor to choose add or update
page ) => i did not create 2 page (Add And Update todo ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š)

Also i didn't realtime the page when (add or update or delete the task) the different will show when
refresh the page After update, add and delete the todo  (because i want do new something in task (
Refresh page ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š))

I made the application compatible for (android & ios) using third party libraries (ScreenUtil)

I made some components to help me for doing the page fast like : (TextFormField && Text)

I did simple Ui ðŸ˜Š , because i prefer do the code (Data) good not Ui (in this task)

I used to do this task :

Clean architecture code (The role 5 by Ankle Bob ) (data,domain and presentation) - Hive for storage
the todo list(NoSql)

Bloc stateManagement (event & state)

Dependency injection using third_party_libraries (GetIt).

Responsive for multi platform (Mobile (android & ios) - Desktop - Web)

Show some beautiful notification for user (Package : flutter toast).

Used abstraction connecting between layer and other layer

third-party-libraries such as : (Bloc | Hive | GetIt | screenUtil | flutterToast | dartz |
pathProvider)

I used Uuid package for generate hard id for every new todo.

In closing ,Thank you all for your good work and commitment.
Let's continue striving for excellence in all our endeavors.

best regards

Ahmad awad
